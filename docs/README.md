# Meet Julian

A few of Julianâ€™s family members have type 2 diabetes so he/she
registers for a 23andMeTM genetic test to find out if he/she is
at risk of having type 2 diabetes too. The results provide
common SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotypes based
on the NCBI human reference genome (a standard version of
the nucleotide sequence of the human genome). The result
shows that Julian has multiple SNPs associated with a highly
increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which makes him/her
worried. Luckily, Julian finds a website called GenoCode and
uploads the genetic test data there. The website gives outputs
of normally-distributed synthetic data that describes the full
possible range of phenotypes (the observable characteristics) for
a given genotype (the genetic constitution) from which Julian
is able to understand the risk better from the visualized data
and realizes that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is not
necessarily as high as what is estimated by 23andMeTM.
By providing relevant scientific articles, the GenoCode
website helps Julain to understand that type 2 diabetes risk
is largely driven by environmental and lifestyle factors that
he/she is able to control.
